Rules enforced by validators. An invalid response cannot be constructed, so a client may
treat these as guarantees rather than as conventions.

Answer shape:
- `full`, `partial` and every `refusal` except `ambiguous_entity` carry a non-empty `answer`.
- `reason_code` is `entity_not_found`, `ambiguous_entity`, `out_of_scope`, `no_decision_path`
  or `low_score` only with outcome `refusal`, and `no_verified_quote` only with outcome
  `partial`. It is null for `full`.
- `entity` is null when `reason_code` is `entity_not_found`, `ambiguous_entity` or
  `out_of_scope`.
- `ambiguous_entity` offers at least two candidates with distinct ids, and its `answer` is null.
- `full` requires at least one citation, at least one of kind SOURCE, and every citation's
  `decision_id` present in `decisions`. `no_verified_quote` forbids citations entirely.
- Every refusal lists at least one entry in `evidence_gaps`.

Confidence:
- `confidence.label` is always derived from `confidence.score`: 0.75 or more is HIGH,
  0.50 up to but not including 0.75 is MEDIUM, below 0.50 is LOW. A supplied label that
  disagrees with the score is rejected, not corrected.
- `full` requires HIGH. `partial` requires MEDIUM, or MEDIUM or LOW when `reason_code` is
  `no_verified_quote`. HIGH is never allowed on a partial.
- A scored refusal, meaning `no_decision_path` or `low_score`, requires MEDIUM or LOW. A
  refusal is never HIGH.
- `entity_not_found`, `ambiguous_entity` and `out_of_scope` are refusals that happen before
  scoring, so confidence is null for them. `no_decision_path` and `low_score` carry a score.
- If `signals.contradiction` is 1 the score is capped at 0.70. `contradiction` is a
  binary `Literal[0.0, 1.0]`, so no intermediate value can bypass the cap. The best score the
  section 7 formula can produce with contradiction 1 is 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.15
  minus 0.30, which is 0.70, so a response with contradiction 1 can never be `full`.

Graph:
- Node ids are unique, at most `MAX_GRAPH_NODES` are returned, and every edge endpoint is
  present in `nodes`. A truncated response sets `truncated` to true, so `truncated: false`
  guarantees the subgraph is complete.

Every response produced by the fixture data source carries `fixture: true`.
